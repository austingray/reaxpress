### Notes

### Roadmap to v1

- Add state management for the current endpoint
- Finish the CLI functionality for routes
- Finish the CLI functionality for users
- Extend the CLI (?)
- Add tests

### Installation

This project relies on webpack.

```
npm install -g webpack
```

And since we want to run migrations in our project directory using the Knex CLI

```
npm install -g knex
```

then

```
npm install
```

This project will expect a Postgres database.

```SQL
CREATE USER <db_user> WITH PASSWORD '<db_password>';
CREATE DATABASE <db_name> OWNER <db_user>;
-- need privileges to install uuid-ossp extension via knex migration
ALTER USER <db_user> WITH SUPERUSER;
```

With defined environment variable:

```
export REAXPRESS_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://username:password@127.0.0.1:5432/database
```

### The CLI

```
./reaxpress.js create <route>
./reaxpress.js remove <route>
./reaxpress.js user create <username> <password> <role>
./reaxpress.js model <name>
```
