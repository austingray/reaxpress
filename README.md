# Reaxpress

(This is an attempt at a Proof of Concept early stage Work in Progress... PoCesWiP!)

A boilerplate bundled with a CLI for rapidly prototyping Express/React sites.

Features:

 - A CLI for generating routes and boilerplate code
 - Universal React components for server and client side rendering

What this is not:

 - This is not a SPA. Each unique URI will serve fresh content from the server.
